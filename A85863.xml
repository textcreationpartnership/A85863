            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This Dignity he obtained by the favour and love of the then excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Biſhop of that <hi>Seat</hi> Dr. <hi>Felton,</hi> a very holy and good man; he had alſo a good Living at <hi>Barlow,</hi> not far from <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where in a Country village, this <hi>good Scribe well-inſtructed for the Kingdom of heaven,</hi> brought forth out of the <hi>good treaſury of his heart things both old and new,</hi> the ancient myſteries and fundamental truths of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, in the modern and more accurate method of revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and reformed learning, conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending in his Preaching and cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing to ordinary capacities, and fitting his net to the fiſh he was to catch.

            <p>§. God ſaw him at preſent more worthy to preſide in the Schools of the Prophets, than to ruſticate (as <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſometimes did) among plain people that <hi>follow the Plough;</hi> not that their ſouls are leſs precious, but plainer and blunter tools will do their work.</p>
            <p>§. Nor was this change of his <hi>Province</hi> an effect of his own <hi>ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi> ſtickling or ſeeking (as I have

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:114684:99"/>heard him uſe, <hi>That nothing was leſs to be ſtickled for or againſt than matters of reremony,</hi> which were as ſhadows not ſubſtances of Religion; As they did not build, ſo they could not burthen, if kept within their bounds, as was done in <hi>Englands Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. Yea, he had ſo far both pity and charity for thoſe plain and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt-hearted people of the <hi>Roman communion,</hi> as either their errors (preſumed by them to be truths) or their ignorance in ſome things not fundamental, did not betray them either to <hi>unbelief</hi> or <hi>ſelf-preſumption,</hi> or to final impenitence, or to immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality or uncharitableneſs.

            <p>§. This he judged the ſafeſt way as to inward and outward peace, in conſcience and prudence, for men and Chriſtians, for Church and State. Accordingly, when <hi>O. P.</hi> with ſome ſhew of reſpect to him, demanded his judgment in ſome publick affairs,

               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:114684:118"/>as to the revenues and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites of his Biſhoprick; yet <hi>aequiore animo ſua damna pertulit, quàm alii ſua lucra;</hi> he ſhewed a greater mind in bearing his loſſes, than others did in getting their gains; yea he was more deeply affected for the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of thoſe that lay under the real guilt, or vehement and juſt <hi>ſuſpition</hi> of ſo <hi>foul a ſin</hi> as <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> than for the loſs he ſuſtained by it; he was prone to ſay chearfully, If others had more right to thoſe <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Houſes</hi> than the Biſhops and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churchmen, in Gods name let them take them; but they that either alienated, or bought or fold them, had need to have a better title than either the preſent propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etors and poſſeſſors had by Law, or the Church and State in equity, or the King by <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> or the Donors by their Deeds, or God, as Lord Paramount, to whoſe glory they were devoted.</p>
            <p>In the alienation of theſe Church eſtates, he looked more to the hand of God which was probative and punitive, than mans, which was
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:114684:118"/>predatorious and paſſionate. I once heard him (after his wonted ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet venerable manner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) profeſs that he took it a little unkindly, that thoſe Lords and Gentlemen (who heretofore had profeſſed an ambition to ſee him a Biſhop, and did with great court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip congratulate his coming to ſit in the Houſe of Lords) not only that they ſhould be great ſticklers to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all Biſhopss as to their honor and eſtates, but that they would not now ſo much as let him have their <hi>Committee power</hi> to gather in the <hi>arrears</hi> of his Biſhoprick, which were due to him before the <hi>direpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>depraedation,</hi> which <hi>arrears</hi> he ſaid were now in thoſe private mens hands, who he thought had leſs right to them, and leſs need of them than himſelf. But he found the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant <hi>Genius</hi> of the times was ſuch, that inſtead of letting Biſhops live in a capacity to be given to <hi>Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality,</hi> they reduced them to the neceſſity of getting into ſome <hi>Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals</hi> for their relief.</p>
            <p>Thus while the Secular Militia,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:114684:119"/>while <hi>Colonels</hi> and <hi>Captains</hi> ride tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly on <hi>horſes</hi> and in <hi>chariots,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The partiality of times, as to the ſpiritual Militia of the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the pomp and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</note> get great Salaries and good Lands, this eminent Biſhop, <hi>who was worthy</hi> to be among the <hi>Chieftains</hi> and prime <hi>Rulers</hi> or <hi>Leaders of the Church,</hi> was (with all other of his order) reduced from his <hi>chariot</hi> and <hi>horſes,</hi> to go on <hi>foot,</hi> as far as his <hi>legs would carry him;</hi> or to <hi>borrow conveniences</hi> of his friends, who were better provided for eaſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of him. Tis true thoſe great Commanders and theſe great Schollars enjoy very different eſtates and eſteem now in this Engliſh world (which we muſt leave all at laſt:) the great queſtion will be, <hi>Who hath the beſt and ſureſt eſtate in another world?</hi> where it will not be enquired <hi>what a man got here,</hi> but <hi>how and with what juſtice;</hi> nor <hi>what he loſt,</hi> but <hi>upon what account,</hi> and <hi>with what pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi> or tranquillity of ſpirit.</p>
            <p>He had no charge for many years before he died but himſelf and a Servant (who was worthy to wait on ſuch a Maſter:)
<note place="margin">His (preſent) fingle life and former mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note> Childe he never had any, though the Husband of

His great grief for the loſs of ſuch a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing at thoſe years (when about for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) ſhewed his great value of it. I have heard it from his conſtant friend and long aſſociate (Dr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Young,</hi> which relation is cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter enough of his worth) that it was a great part of his friendly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment at that time <hi>(flagrante do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lore.)</hi> to be as an <hi>Angel to comfort</hi> Dr. <hi>Brounrig</hi> in that ſolitude and ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

            <p>§. I have heard from good hands a paſſage not unworthy of ſuch a pair, which I think not a miſs to relate; His wife brought him a very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom eſtate in mony, and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptionary, and ſo likely to die without child, ſhe deſired him to give her leave to give away by will as ſhe pleaſed to her friends ſome part of that eſtate ſhe brought him; he moſt chearfully granted her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire (if ſhe would to the half or all her eſtate;) ſhe having made this eſſay of his noble mind, told him with thanks and tears, That ſhe gave all ſhe had to him as her beſt friend, and one that deſerved much more than ſhe could give him; ſoon after ſhe left him and all ſublunary comforts.</p>
            <p>§. After times ſhewed him what a providence it was by ſo ingenuous a way to have ſomething of eſtate caſt in to defend himſelf againſt the after-injuries and preſſures of life, beſides learning and merit; for that
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:114684:120"/>eſtate (I think) was his beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; though the diſtreſs of times had ſhrewdly <hi>wire-drawn</hi> that alſo before he died.</p>
            <p>§.
<note place="margin">His reception and welcome to friends.</note> Being looſed from thoſe ſilken cords and golden chains of a good wife, and married no more (adding an honor to <hi>celebacy</hi> as well as to <hi>marriage)</hi> he carried with him no train beyond one ſervant; this made his <hi>motions</hi> more expedite, and his receptions more eaſie; for many headed gueſts, like <hi>Hydra's</hi> either ſcare away, or ſoon eat up their <hi>own welcom;</hi> eſpecially if they be only as caterpillars are, <hi>fruges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumere nati;</hi> only to eat, to chat, and to play; but this <hi>worthy perſon</hi> was ſo venerable and uſeful, that he was ever moſt <hi>welcom</hi> to thoſe who well underſtood, that to entertain him was indeed to entertain au An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel in fleſh and blood, a grand <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,</hi> a <hi>Cherubick ſpirit,</hi> a <hi>Seraphick ſoul,</hi> a <hi>true Saint;</hi> both as a Biſhop of the Church, and as a very holy man.</p>
            <p>§. Indeed none could be <hi>hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> to him <hi>gratis;</hi> he always paid largely for his entertainments, not

            <pb n="209" facs="tcp:114684:121"/>

               </gap>) <hi>power</hi> and warmth of his delivery (who always preached in good earneſt, as well as he took great pains) would have deceived a very judicious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory, to have believed they were premeditated and penned: His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was neither to over-preach his audience, nor under-preach his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but to fit both ſo, that neither the Text nor the people ſhould have cauſe to think themſelves ſlighted. This I obſerve on the by, as to his converſation and diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>§. To his learned and ready abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities were added the bleſſing of a very <hi>happy hiſtorick memory;</hi> which by a <hi>latitude, commenſurate</hi> to his underſtanding and judgement, had not ſwallowed up, and crammed it ſelf with all he read or heard; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving weighed the worth and credit of all hiſtorick paſſages, had diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treaſured up ſo great variety of very remarkable things both old and new experiments, that he was both by his ſufficiency or ſtore (as <hi>Condus</hi>) in laying up; and by his <hi>prudence</hi> (as <hi>Promus</hi>) in bringing
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:114684:122"/>them out, rarely fitted for all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and occaſions, that were worthy of his owning.</p>

               </gap>) a man of great integrity may not be unworthy of obſervation.</p>
            <p>§. His Lordſhip (a few weeks before he died) told me, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Dr. <hi>Bernard,</hi> his very faithful friend, and ſervant, that
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:114684:123"/>his Lordſhip was aſſured from the relation of a <hi>Dutch</hi> Miniſter of his particular acquaintance, having li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved long in <hi>England,</hi> a man of good learning, and of a moſt religious plain-heartedneſs in his life; That this <hi>Dutch man</hi> coming from <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and being caſt away <hi>by ſtorm</hi> far from ſhore, he floated (not knowing how to ſwim) on the face of the deep, as deſpairing of life, and half dead, yet not forgetting to <hi>invocate Gods mercy:</hi> After two hours diſtreſs, lying now on his back and toſſed at the pleaſure of wind and waves, a veſſel came by him under ſail, and took him up; when he was aboard the ſhip, the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Mariners helped to relieve him with dry clothes; and while they were looking on him as a <hi>dren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched</hi> and almoſt <hi>drowned</hi> man, to their <hi>great wonder,</hi> they ſaw on the back of his coat toward the middle, a <hi>perfect print of a mans hand,</hi> which by its different colour ſhewed it was dry, as indeed it was, like <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deons fleece,</hi> when the flore was all wet about it; This the good man
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:114684:123"/>himſelf, when he had pulled off his <hi>apper garment,</hi> ſaw, admired and bleſſed God, acknowledging that he ſeemed as upheld by a Divine hand from ſinking all that time he was floating and helpleſs on the ſea; this he averred on his faith to God and man, to this excellent Biſhop; whoſe belief of it makes me think it not only credible, but true and worthy of memory.</p>
            <p>He could never be perſwaded to ſet forth any thing of his own in print;
<note place="margin">Why he would never Print any thing.</note> Although my ſelf and others have oft moved him while yet he had vigor and leiſure enough; either to take this <hi>pious revenge</hi> on the age which had injured it ſelf moſt, by laying him aſide, or to give the <hi>better world</hi> this great ſatisfaction, either as to ſome <hi>ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate pieces</hi> he had made, and by word of mouth publiſhed in <hi>Sermons</hi> or <hi>Determinations,</hi> and <hi>other Speeches at Commencements:</hi> Or as to his judgment in ſome grand <hi>caſes of diſpute,</hi> in which he had a great happineſs to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend things fully, to ſtate the

            <p>§.

            <p>§. This made him wrap up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in <hi>ſilence,</hi> as to any way of <hi>printing:</hi> Leaving the debates and <hi>ſcuffles</hi> of the times, as to <hi>Church and State,</hi> either to younger men, who were more <hi>daring,</hi> and could better endure the heat and burthen of the day, or to be <hi>anſwered</hi> and

            <p>§. Yet will it not (I preſume) be any regret to his <hi>bleſſed ſpirit,</hi> if thoſe pieces which remain perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his own hand, be redeemed from the darkneſs or twilight of <hi>Manuſcripts,</hi> and brought forth to the day and ſunſhine of <hi>Printing;</hi> that in their light we may ſee ſome <hi>genuine beams</hi> of that <hi>burning</hi> and <hi>ſhining light,</hi> which was in the ſoul of <hi>Biſhop Brounrig:</hi> And certainly if he had (after the example of the beſt of Emperors and Heathens that ever lived, <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi>) his (<gap reason="foreign">

            <p>He was always (when in health) as chearful (as far as the Tragedies of the times gave leave) as one that had the <hi>continual feaſt of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> and as content,

            <p>§. But this rich banquet was not to laſt long; a little of Biſhop <hi>Broun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rig</hi> was a great deal for any one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to have.</p>

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:114684:129"/>him, and were capable of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, even till he was much ſpent and weary, as I have heard him complain.</p>
            <p>God was pleaſed to exerciſe him with bodily pains,
<note place="margin">His bodily paines and infirmities.</note> indiſpoſitions and diſtempers, ſometimes with <hi>ſharp fits of the ſtone,</hi> and <hi>hydropick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,</hi> which made the chariot of his body (which was ſomewhat plethorick and corpulent) drive heavily, though thoſe fiery horſes, his fervent ſpirits were ſtill agile and able.
